                what="We’ve created a platform called Erfaren, designed to allow older individuals to share their knowledge and experiences by creating courses and posts. The platform facilitates the exchange of wisdom between generations, providing an opportunity for meaningful connections to be built."
                why="Older individuals often experience loneliness. Our goal with Erfaren is to reduce loneliness by creating a space where older people can share their experiences and make new connections. Through interviews with our target audience, we discovered their preference for larger screens over mobile devices for accessibility and ease of use, which helped shape our design decisions."
                process="The project began with brainstorming sessions to identify the issues we wanted to address. We conducted interviews with our target group to gather insights and inform our decisions. After defining the design direction, we sketched ideas on paper, followed by prototyping in Figma. We drew inspiration from accessible websites like Skatteverket and 1177 to ensure our platform met WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). In the implementation phase, we developed the website using SvelteKit and chose SupaBase for the database due to its real-time features and open-source nature."
                result="The outcome is a fully functional website where older individuals can create and participate in courses, share their experiences, and engage in video calls with other people eager to learn something new."

                why="We wanted to explore how movement and creativity could be combined into a playful and social experience. By using GPS as part of the core gameplay, we aimed to create a fun way for people to interact through drawing and guessing in real-world locations."
                process="The project started with brainstorming different game ideas centered around creativity and movement. Once we settled on the concept of a GPS-based drawing game, we defined the core features and built initial prototypes. We used React Native for cross-platform development, and integrated libraries like react-native-maps for GPS tracking and socket.io for real-time communication."
                result="The result is a fully functional mobile game where players can create drawings based on their GPS coordinates, share their creations with others, and guess each other’s drawings in a fun and interactive environment. The game encourages creativity and social interaction while offering a unique take on location-based gaming."
